## objects
* [basics](https://github.com/dl-watson/career-track-prework/blob/objects/basics.js)
  * this exercise explored different shorthand notations for working with object literals. 
* [computed-properties](https://github.com/dl-watson/career-track-prework/blob/objects/computed-properties.js)
  * this exercise expanded upon concepts established in the first, adding the concept of a computed property, and illustrating different contexts in which computed properties may be used. 

## classes
* [creation](https://github.com/dl-watson/career-track-prework/blob/classes/creation.js)
  * this exercise explored class creation syntax, and how to define a method inside a class body. 
* [extends](https://github.com/dl-watson/career-track-prework/blob/classes/extends.js)
  * this exercise explored class inheritance with `extends`, and how resulting family tree relationships are interpreted. 
* [statics](https://github.com/dl-watson/career-track-prework/blob/classes/statics.js)
  * this exercise introduced the concept of a static method or property; static members are called without instantiating their class and *cannot* be called through a class instance.
