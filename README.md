## objects
* [basics](https://github.com/dl-watson/career-track-prework/blob/objects/basics.js)
  * this exercise explored different shorthand notations for working with object literals. 
* [computed-properties](https://github.com/dl-watson/career-track-prework/blob/objects/computed-properties.js)
  * this exercise expanded upon concepts established in the first, adding the concept of a computed property, and illustrating different contexts in which computed properties may be used. 

## classes
* [creation](https://github.com/dl-watson/career-track-prework/blob/classes/creation.js)
  * this exercise explored class creation syntax, and how to define a method inside a class body. 
* [extends](https://github.com/dl-watson/career-track-prework/blob/classes/extends.js)
  * this exercise explored class inheritance with `extends`, and how resulting family tree relationships are interpreted. 
* [statics](https://github.com/dl-watson/career-track-prework/blob/classes/statics.js)
  * this exercise introduced the concept of a static method or property; static members are called without instantiating their class and *cannot* be called through a class instance. 

## destructuring
* [array-destructuring](https://github.com/dl-watson/career-track-prework/blob/destructuring/array-destructuring.js)
  * this exercise introduced syntax for destructuring arrays to make shorter code, and how to extract specific elements from arrays using this syntax. 
* [destructuring-function-parameters](https://github.com/dl-watson/career-track-prework/blob/destructuring/destructuring-function-parameters.js)
  * this exercise most helpfully introduced the concept of a default function parameter, a concept that's returned to in the _function-defaults_ section. 
* [destructuring-with-alias](https://github.com/dl-watson/career-track-prework/blob/destructuring/destructuring-with-alias.js)
  * this exercise explored how to assign property values to new variables while destructuring. 
* [destructuring-with-defaults](https://github.com/dl-watson/career-track-prework/blob/destructuring/destructuring-with-defaults.js)
  * this exercise expanded on the previous section, exploring how to implement this concept within different primitive datatypes. 
* [object-destructuring](https://github.com/dl-watson/career-track-prework/blob/destructuring/object-destructuring.js)
  * this exercise explored destructuring with objects, objects containing arrays or arrays containing objects, and special cases involving undefined refs and builtins. 
* [string-destructuring](https://github.com/dl-watson/career-track-prework/blob/destructuring/string-destructuring.js)
  * this exercise demonstrated how to use destructuring with strings. 

## rest
* [rest-as-a-parameter](https://github.com/dl-watson/career-track-prework/blob/rest/rest-as-a-parameter.js)
  * this exercise introduced the rest parameter, which must be the last parameter, can be used to get all other parameters, and may eliminate arguments passed as function parameters. 
* [rest-while-destructuring](https://github.com/dl-watson/career-track-prework/blob/rest/rest-while-destructuring.js)
  * rest may also be used while destructuring.

## spread
* [array-spread](https://github.com/dl-watson/career-track-prework/blob/spread/array-spread.js)
  * spread may be used to expand all items in a collection and collect them, or to capture function parameters. 

## function-defaults
* [function-defaults](https://github.com/dl-watson/career-track-prework/blob/function-defaults/function-defaults.js)
  * function defaults are particularly useful in a situation when `undefined` is passed. defaults are evaluated at runtime.
